# Project Journal (The chaos behind the build)
Hey folks ðŸ‘‹
Hope youâ€™re doing great! This file documents my entire journey of building this project â€” from the thought process and mindset to the execution and iterations.

If youâ€™re curious about how I approach building things, this journal is where youâ€™ll find everything that goes beyond just the final project.


1. This is the initial setup phase of the project, where I started by initializing it with the latest version of Next.js. Moving forward, I configured the Neon database (PostgreSQL) and installed Prisma for database management.

2. Following the project references, my current focus is on setting up Prisma and defining a few models in the schema.prisma file as the first step toward structuring the database.
